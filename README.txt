This C# console application shows a number of working functions that are asked for during interviews.

The application prints "Hello World", the UTC time, shows fizzbuzz, fills and shows an employee database, asks for a word
and tells if it is a palindrome, asks for two words and tells if they are anagrams of each other, and then takes a sum and a list of
integers and tells if two numbers in the list equal the sum.

All these functions are written using best practices in C#, as can be seen in the Program.cs code.
